# Mysql-to-influxdb
Quick hack to get data from MySQL into influx db to display with Graphite and Grafana. This is a quick script I created for a very specific use case so it <b>won't</b> copy your whole database over magically. If you need this you can modify the script to fit your needs.

This script will meant to run constantly or one time and send data from a single table in MYSQL to influx. If you have multiple tables this will be an issue. Also it requires that the MYSQL table is altered to have a specific column which indicates whether this piece of data has been copied to influx already or not.
